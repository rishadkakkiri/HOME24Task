# HOME24Task

i have used three 3rd party frameworks in this application and its written in swift 4

1) Alamofire :- Alamofire focused specifically on core networking implementations, additional component libraries have been created by the  Alamofire Software Foundation to bring additional functionality to the Alamofire ecosystem.

2) SDWebImage :- This library provides an async image downloader with cache support. For convenience, we added categories for UI elements like UIImageView, UIButton, MKAnnotationView.

4) UPCarouselFlowLayout-master :- UPCarouselFlowLayout is a fancy carousel flow layout for UICollectionView. It comes with a paginated effect and it shrinks and makes transparent the side items.
